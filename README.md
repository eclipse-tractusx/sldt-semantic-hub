# Semantic Hub
The Semantic Hub is a logical and architectural component of Tractus-X.
The source code under this folder contains reference implementations of the SLDT Semantic Hub

## Build Packages

Run `mvn install` to run unit tests, build and install the package.

## Run Package Locally
To check whether the build was successful, you can start the resulting JAR file from the build process by running `java -jar target/semantic-hub-{current-version}.jar`.

## Build Docker
Run `docker build -t semantic-hub .`

In case you want to publish your image into a remote container registry, apply the tag accordingly and `docker push` the image.

## Deploy using Helm and K8s
If you have a running Kubernetes cluster available, you can deploy the Semantic Hub using our Helm Chart, which is located under `./deployment/semantic-hub`.
In case you don't have a running cluster, you can set up one by yourself locally, using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
In the following, we will use a minikube cluster for reference.

Before deploying the Semantic Hub, enable a few add-ons in your minikube cluster by running the following commands:

`minikube addons enable storage-provisioner`

`minikube addons enable default-storageclass`

`minikube addons enable ingress`

In order to deploy the helm chart, first create a new namespace "semantics": `kubectl create namespace semantics`.

Then run `helm install hub -n semantics ./deployment/semantic-hub`. This will set up a new helm deployment in the semantics namespace. By default, the deployment contains the Semantic Hub instance itself, and a Fuseki Triplestore.

Check that the two containers are running by calling `kubectl get pod -n semantics`.

To access the Semantic Hub API from the host, you need to configure the `Ingress` resource.
By default, the Semantic Hub includes an `Ingress` that exposes the API on https://minikube/semantics/hub

For that to work, you need to append `/etc/hosts` by running `echo "$(minikube ip) minikube" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`.

For automated certificate generation, use and configure [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).
By default, authentication is deactivated, please adjust `hub.authentication` if needed

## Parameters
The Helm Chart can be configured using the following parameters (incomplete list). For a full overview, please see the [values.yaml](backend/deployment/semantic-hub/values.yaml).

### Semantic Hub
| Parameter       | Description | Default value       |
| ---             | ---         | ---                 |
| `hub.image`     | The registry and image of the Semantic Hub   | `semantic-hub:latest` |
| `hub.embeddedTripleStore`     | Configures whether the Semantic Hub uses its non-persistent embedded in-memory Triplestore. If set to `true`, no separate Fuseki instance is deployed. | `false` |
| `hub.host`     | This value is used by the `Ingress` object (if enabled) to route traffic.   | `minikube` |
| `hub.authentication`     | Enables OAuth2 based authentication/authorization.   | `false` |
| `hub.idpIssuerUri`     | The issuer URI of the OAuth2 identity provider.   | `http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/catenax` |
| `hub.graphdbBaseUrl`     | The URL of an external GraphDB. Ignored if `graphdb.enabled` is set to `false`   | `http://graphdb:3030` |
| `hub.ingress.enabled`     | Configures if an `Ingress` resource is created.   | `true` |
| `hub.ingress.tls`     | Configures whether the `Ingress` should include TLS configuration. In that case, a separate `Secret` (as defined by `hub.ingress.tlsSecretName`) needs to be provided manually or by using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)   | `true` |
| `hub.ingress.tlsSecretName`     | The `Secret` name that contains a `tls.crt` and `tls.key` entry. Subject Alternative Name must match the `hub.host`    | `hub-certificate-secret` |
| `hub.ingress.urlPrefix`     | The url prefix that is used by the `Ingress` resource to route traffic  | `/semantics/hub` |
| `hub.ingress.className`     | The `Ingress` class name   | `nginx` |
| `hub.ingress.annotations`     | Annotations to further configure the `Ingress` resource, e.g. for using with `cert-manager`.  |  |

### GraphDB
| Parameter       | Description | Default value       |
| ---             | ---         | ---                 |
| `graphdb.enabled`     | Configures, whether a separate Fuseki Triplestore should be deployed in the cluster.   | `true` |
| `graphdb.storageClassName`     | Defines the storage class name of the `PersistentVolumeClaim` that is used to persist the GraphDB data.  | `standard` |
| `graphdb.storageSize`     | Size of the `PersistentVolumeClaim`  | `50Gi` |
